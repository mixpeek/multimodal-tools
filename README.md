# üß∞ Multimodal Tools

A collection of simple, standalone Python scripts for working with **video, audio, image, and text** data ‚Äî designed for developers exploring multimodal AI.

Each utility lives in its own folder with examples and a CLI-friendly interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mixpeek/multimodal-tools.git
cd multimodal-tools

# Pick a tool and follow its README
cd segment_transcript_by_topic
pip install -r requirements.txt
python segment_transcript.py --input path/to/video.mp4
```

## üöÄ Why use these?

Multimodal content is everywhere ‚Äî but tooling is scattered. This repo brings together focused, no-dependency-heavy scripts to help you get things done without setting up complex pipelines.

Ideal for:
- Prototyping and experimentation
- Content analysis workflows
- ML/AI feature extraction
- Exploring retrieval use cases

## üîå Looking for hosted feature extractors?

If you want to scale beyond local scripts, [Mixpeek](https://mixpeek.com/extractors) offers managed, production-ready multimodal extractors (video, image, audio, and more) you can plug into your stack.
